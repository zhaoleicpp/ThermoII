在椭圆中，两焦点对射，会出现两焦点，发射与接收对方焦点一样的情况。但是设想着，改变一下图形，见图，两个大小不一样的椭圆，在画图后，就会出现，小的椭圆焦点会全部，射到大的椭圆焦点上，而大的椭圆焦点，会有部分射线被返回，由此会导致大的椭圆焦点接收对方射线多，而升温。反之而小的椭圆焦点接收对方射线少而降温。故在一个系统中，出现温差，得到熵减。



In an ellipse, the two focus is focused, and a two focus is emitted, as is the focus of the receiver's focus. But imagine, change the graphics, see Figure two, the ellipse size, will appear in the drawing, a small, elliptical focus will all focus on the big shot to the ellipse, and large elliptical focus, there will be some rays is returned, which will lead to the focal point of the ellipse each receiving ray more warming. Conversely, the smaller elliptical focus receives less radiation and cools the other. Therefore, in a system, there is a temperature difference, entropy reduction is obtained.
